* Purty Mode
  purty-mode.el --- Safely pretty-print greek letters, mathematical symbols, or anything else.

** Commentary
   purty-mode is a minor mode which swaps whatever-regexp-you-want for
   whatever-symbol-you-want on the fly.  Given that the text itself is
   left untouched, purty-mode can safely be used when writing code or
   latex or org or whatever.

** Setup
   Just place purty-mode.el somewhere on your load path, and add
   (require 'purty-mode) to your .emacs.

** Customization
   Substitutions can be added by appending (regexp . string) pairs to
   purty-regexp-symbol-pairs:
   
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq purty-regexp-symbol-pairs (cons '(" Xi " . " Îž ") purty-regexp-symbol-pairs))
#+end_src

** Acknowledgements
   This source is essentially an extension of Mark Trigg's lambda-mode.el.
